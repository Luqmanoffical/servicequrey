                    Protecting children's privacy is especially important to us. The Company recognizes that parents,

                    do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing purposes, but
                    because some information is collected electronically, it can appear to be the personal information
                    of the purchaser of the product and will be treated as such by this privacy policy. If a child under
                    13 submits personal information to the Company and we learn that that personal information is the
                    information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. It
                    is our policy to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other
                    applicable laws. Therefore, we restrict our web sites to people 18 years or older.

                    also enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read. And they tell us whether
